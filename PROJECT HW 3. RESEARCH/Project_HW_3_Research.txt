PROJECT HOMEWORK 3
Author: Oxana Howard

---------------------


- Data I need to collect from the user:
    > Login credentials (e.g., username and password).
    > Dietary restrictions.
    > Preferred cuisine types.
    > Favorite recipes.
    > Grocery list.
    > Individual menu.

- Data I need to collect from an external source:
    > Recipe information (e.g., name, ingredients, instructions, nutritional information).
    > Cuisine type information.
    > Ingredient information.

I might use the following third-party library, framework, or HTTP API:
    > Java Spring Boot framework.
    > React.js framework.
    > React Router library.
    > Redux.

    
In order to conduct research on external APIs, I will be exploring a variety of 
options and selecting the one that is best suited for my project. The APIs that 
I will be considering include Spoonacular, MyCookbook.io, Tasty, 
Edamam Recipe Search & Diet, Edamam Nutrition Analysis, Webknox Recipe, 
Zestful Recipe & Ingredient Analysis, Yummly, and TheMealDB.
By evaluating the features and capabilities of each API, I will be able 
to choose the one that offers the most appropriate functionality for my needs.

Static data:
    > User account information.
    > Saved favorite recipes.
