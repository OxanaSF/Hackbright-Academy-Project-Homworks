PROJECT HOMEWORK 2
Author: Oxana Howard

---------------------


Potential Features of the Project.

- The web application will allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients, 
dietary restrictions, and cuisine type using an external API. 
- User will be able to use user authentication and save their favorite recipes,
  generate grocery lists, and a meal planner to plan meals for the week. 
- The back-end will use Spring Boot to build a RESTful API that interacts with the external recipe API and provides 
the front-end with a standardized JSON response.
- The front-end will be built using React for login-in/login-out, browsing search results 
and viewing recipe details.
